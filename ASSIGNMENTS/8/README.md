#Assignment 8

In the last assignment you you integrated 
[filters](/Users/tejaswi/Downloads/ame2200Spring2017/canvas-filters) to
[Darkroom.js](https://github.com/MattKetmo/darkroomjs).

Now make these changes editable i.e Store the filter as a seperate entry
in the database.

So how do we display the filters to the user? [CSS
filters](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_filter) !


## Submisssion

Email me the IP address as URL (again). e.g if your server IP was 12.56.134.53,
then my submission URL would be **http://12.56.134.53/index.html**
